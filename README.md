# Portfolio
To do:
link projects in projects section
Add github and Linkedin links at bottom
Make Contact Me section actually useful

My portfolio page is just one page, and includes professional summary, about me, work experience, projects, and contact me sections. There are quite a few placeholder sections right now, but I figure those are lower priority than just making sure the site works. I broke my css into four files more or less just for my own convenience, general readability, and to experiment with how CSS cascades. 

Features: 
    Navigation menu: The page has a hamburger menu on mobile screens, which expand to a header with links on tablets and desktop. The hamburger menu uses javascript to show/hide content on click. 

    Use flexbox or grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views: My projects section changes from one column, to two columns and two rows, to one row based on the size of the screen, using media queries. 

    Create a form: I created a contact me form with field validation that uses an alert to display the name they input along with a message saying I'll get back to them. Both the name and email input fields check for empty strings, and the email field uses a regular expression to make sure their email is valid. I use alert to display error messages if validation fails.

    Show/hide one or more content areas with javascript: I already mentioned my hamburger menu, which uses javascript to show/hide
