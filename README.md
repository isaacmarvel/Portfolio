# Portfolio
My portfolio page is just one page, and includes professional summary, about me, work experience, projects, and contact me sections. There are quite a few placeholder sections right now, but I figure those are lower priority than just making sure the site works. The resume and project links don't work, but it would be easy enough to get them working, that's not a concern. I also haven't uploaded an image of myself yet because I'm not sure which to use, so that's just an empty box for now. 

Features: 
    Navigation menu: The page has a hamburger menu on mobile screens, which expand to a header with links on tablets and desktop. The hamburger menu uses javascript to show/hide content on click. 

    Use flexbox or grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views: My projects section changes from one column, to two columns and two rows, to one row based on the size of the screen, using media queries. 

    Create a form: I created a contact me form with javascript field validation that uses an alert to display the name they input along with a message saying I'll get back to them. Both the name and email input fields check for empty strings, and the email field uses a regular expression to make sure their email is valid. I use alert to display error messages if validation fails. Obviously sumbitting doesn't really do anything at this point, it's just for show. 

    Show/hide one or more content areas with javascript: I already mentioned my hamburger menu, which uses javascript to show/hide.
