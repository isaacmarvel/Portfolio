Features: 

Navigation menu: The page has a hamburger menu on mobile screens, which expand to a header with links on tablets and desktop. The hamburger menu uses javascript to show/hide content on click. 

Use flexbox or grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views: My projects section changes from one column, to two columns and two rows, to one row based on the size of the screen, using Grid and media queries. 

Create a form: I created a contact me form with javascript field validation that uses an alert to display the name they input along with a message saying I'll get back to them. Both the name and email input fields check for empty strings, and the email field uses a regular expression to make sure their email is valid. I use alert to display error messages if validation fails. Obviously sumbitting doesn't really do anything at this point, it's just for show. 

Show/hide one or more content areas with javascript: I already mentioned my hamburger menu, which uses javascript to show/hide.
